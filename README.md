#NOTE:: ALL FILES REQUIRED MUST BE PUT IN SAME DIRECTORY
this project  was designed to be as independant from local files as possible; however, there is one file you must download for this to work if you do not want to download selenium.
click on the  CSV download button for exports by country https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/exports-by-country

Otherwise, there is an autohotkey selenium module included that will automate this process but you will have to download selenium for python and autohotkey.
